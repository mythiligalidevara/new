<!-- async makes a function return a Promise
await makes a function wait for a Promise -->
<!-- Async: It simply allows us to write promises-based code as
 if it was synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the execution thread. It operates asynchronously via the event loop.
 Async functions will always return a value. It makes sure that a promise is returned and if it is not returned then 
 JavaScript automatically wraps it in a promise which is resolved with its value.
 Await: Await function is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within the async block only. 
 It makes the code wait until the promise returns a result. It only makes the async block wait. -->

//     async function f() {

// let promise=new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
//     setTimeout(function() {
//         resolve("done !!");}, 1000);
// })

// let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)

// alert(result); // "done!"

// }

// f();
