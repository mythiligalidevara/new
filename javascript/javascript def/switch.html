    <!-- Consider a situation when we want to test a variable for hundred different values and 
    based on the test we want to execute some task. Using if-else statements for this purpose will be less efficient
     than switch-case statements and also it will make the code look messy.

    The switch case statement is a multiway branch statement. 
    It provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.    -->

 let i = 9;
 
 
 switch (i)
 {
 case 0:
     console.log("i is zero.");
     break;
 case 1:
     console.log("i is one.");
     break;
 case 2:
     console.log("i is two.");
     break;
 default:
     console.log("i is greater than 2.");
